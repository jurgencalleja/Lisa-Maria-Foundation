          <h2>Proposals regarding the effective recruitment and selection procedures for adults working with children and young people</h2>
          <p>The Lisa Maria Foundation knows full well that the great majority of teachers and adults working with children are a major positive influence in their lives, helping them to learn and grow in a safe and nurturing environment. Experience in this country and beyond our shores, however, has shown that exceptionally, individuals who may constitute a danger to children find employment positions working in proximity with them. Unfortunately, the danger that these individuals can do there is massively disproportionate and wholly unacceptable.</p>
